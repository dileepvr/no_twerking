Arch uses systemd to run daemons.

Create a service file in:
/etc/systemd/system/<name-of-service>.service

For contents, see unsecure_chat.service file for example.

Then, in command line, execute following two commands:
> sudo systemctl start <name-of-service>
> sudo systemctl enable <name-of-service>

The second command ensures that daemon is started on boot.
There are special parameters that can go into service file to handle restarts upon daemon crash/exit, and logging using syslog, etc.
